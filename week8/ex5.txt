Physical address is an address in physical memory that implemented in hardware.
Virtual address is an address in virtual memory that is an abstraction.

There can be more virtual addresses than physical addresses. Virtual  memory maps to the physical memory(mapping can be changed by OS)
Virtual addresses might be not mapped to anywhere( if we try to refer to unmapped address -> trap == page fault -> os swap the required address with one less-used, remap and restart)

It's quicklier to access by physical address.
